OpenAudible FFmpeg builds
===============================

This fork creates ffmpeg/ffprobe binaries used for OpenAudible, an audibobook management desktop application. 

These binaries only include the codecs, filters, and muxers that are needed for OpenAudible (mp3/m4b/m4a and cover artwork). 

We add a small patch to allow additional metadata in m4a/m4b tags.  

We produce binaries for Linux (x86_64), Mac (arm64 and x86_64), and Windows (x86_64).

Thank you to AcousticID for their ffmpeg-build github actions. Incredible to build 4 static binaries for ffmpeg in under 6 minutes. 

Building is done using GitHub Actions. You can find the built binaries on the releases page.

  - Linux
      * `x86\_64-linux-gnu`
